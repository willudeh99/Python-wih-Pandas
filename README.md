# Python-wih-Pandas

This was a small project where I played around with excel files and did comparisons using pandas tools.

I started with cleaning the data and making sure that when it was time to concatenate there would be little to fix. Before that i changed the data type of one of the columns to match the other dataframes.

I then used some pandas tools such as corr(), to find any correlation between the returns data for each company. Then used the pandas graphing tool to make visualizations of those.
